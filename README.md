# the15game

The classic 15 game. Drag the tiles to the empty area and try to get them in the right order. The original version of the game is set to 16 cells that creates the puzzle board. But Its possible to change the size of the game (and make it bigger or smaller) by changing the size prop at line 16 in the component "Puzzle". 

This game is built in react and uses components and props that is being validated trough propTypes. 

I built this using the web as my source. That ment using older tutorials with class components. If I had more time i would of re-written the code to be all ES6 using React hooks instead of classes.
